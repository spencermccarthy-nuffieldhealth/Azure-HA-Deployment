**The Purpose of this template is to allow you to launch a second VM-Series into an existing resource group because the Azure Marketplace will not allow this.**   

You will still be responsible for configuring your own Azure HA settings within the Azure Portal and the VM-Series firewall. Please refer to the VM-Series deployment guide for 9.0 for configuration details.

# Manual Approach

If you choose to take a different approach you can do the following

1. Launch a VM-Series firewall using the latest which is 9.0(only needed if you don't have an existing VM-Series launched)
2. Use Azure CLI to launch a second VM-Series running PAN-OS 8.1 into the exact same Resource Group as the first firewall
